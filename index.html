            This website is the culminating project for our ISC 325: Hypermedia class offered this semester Spring
			2019 at SUNY Oswego. The class tasked us with emerging from our humble abode on campus into the
			town of Oswego. Giving the students the criteria of designing a multimedia project on one aspect of the
			city of Oswego. Our group and its members have such decided to take you on a Haunted Tour of
			Oswego. Focusing on a few of the many haunted sites in Oswego and displaying their historical accounts
			and stories of the paranormal. Helping to assist in creating a more fluid integration between the work of
			college students and the connected town of Oswego.
