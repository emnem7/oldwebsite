        <p>
            Ye olde Oswego, a town with a history as rich as the Egyptian pharaohs. Its history unravels from the Native Americans who used the town’s waterways in their everyday life, to the bustling college town it is today. Throughout the county, 19th and 20th-century buildings, cemeteries, bridges, canal locks, railroad and numerous other man-made structures give us a glimpse into the town’s rich history.
<br><br>However, hidden beneath its tales of glory, are incidents that could make one’s hair stand on its ends. Whispers can be heard about flickering lights in the lighthouse, screams coming from the woods, and a woman in a white nightgown wandering around the Route 57 hill. Once you’ve heard the stories, there’s no going back. For those who seek the thrill of fear, we’ve compiled a few such myths -- or are they?.
